# Fundraising *Ice, the book*

Ice, the book, ingeniously designed by graphical designer Lies Ros with a preface of Tijs Goldschmidt (winner P.C. Hooft-Prijs 2023), contains about 34 small texts and circa 35 fascinating historical photographs that tell about the incredible worldwide history of the ice-trade. As well as in form and story, the book is clear as ice. It started with natural ice, changed to industrial-made ice, and connected people worldwide, from America to India, Norway to The Netherlands, and Indonesia.

The form is inventive and readable from both sides. If you read the book in English, the story starts with the refrigerator and returns to the trade in natural ice. If one reads it in Dutch, it starts with natural ice and unfolds chronologically toward the time of the refrigerator. Every text has a title with the word ice in it, from ‘ice harvest’ to ‘ice cellar,’ from ‘dead ice hole’ to ‘ice plough.’ Transparent pages will be part of the book; the cover itself is also transparent, and the word ICE shines through.
